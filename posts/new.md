*What did you work on this week?*
This week, we worked on integrating the feedback we got in the last week's presentation into our overall application design and userflow. As a group, we redesigned several main user flow pages, including the game thread page and the game list page.

What did you learn?
As a designer, I learned a lot this week in terms of designing clean and modern pages that are also intuive and clear to use. It was also crucial for our team to include everyone's inputs into building the theme and design.

What was difficult?
It was difficult to compromise when we conflicted often about different design ideas. It really forced us to figure out how to compromise with each other and come up with the best possible design.

What was effective about both your personal and your groups workflow? Ineffective?

I think one effective aspect of our workflow was that everyone is generally always contributing in one way or another. I also allowed people to pick and choose what they wanted to work on. 

Any additional thoughts on your product

There is definitely a potential for an awesome project that if we channel our passion into the right avenues, Slice-It can be great application that provides unique value to the users.
