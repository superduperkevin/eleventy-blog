#### What did you work on this week?
This week, initially,I worked on developing the login and signup page but later we changed our design, which forced me to work on creating the leaderboard page. I'm currently still working on the leaderboard page as well as its child components.

#### What did you learn?
I learned that I need to continue to get better at my development skills and increase my personal velocity.

#### What was difficult?
It was a lot of work not only changing tasks mid week but also working completely alone on creating such a big page from scratch was a lot of work.

#### What was effective about both your personal and your groups workflow? Ineffective?

I think having two monitors is completely life-changing. It allows me to style much faster because I'm able to see my render in real time on the second screen.

#### Any additional thoughts on your product

I feel like we're rushing to complete the application up and running by the beginning of the season and it has been a lot of work for all of us trying to meet that deadline that we set on ourselves.
